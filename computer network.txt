Ã§omputer networks:
		a network consists of two or more nodes (e.g computers ) thar are linked in order to share resources (such as printers and CDs) exchange files, or allow electronic cmmunications . the computer on network may be linked through cables , telephone lines , radio waves , satellites , or infrared light beams.

* "a computer network is a set of computer connected together for the purpose of sharing resources." the most common resource shared today is connection to the internet. other shared resources can include a printer or a file server.

* "computer on a network are called nodes."
	the connection between computers can be done via cabling , most commonly the ethernet cable , or wirelessly through radio waves. connected computer can share resources, like access to the internet,printers k file seves, and others.

* goals of networking+-

1. resource and load sharing 
2.programs do  not need to run on a single machine 
3. reduced cost
4.several machines can share printer,tape drives,ect.
5.high reliability 
6.if a machine goes down , another can take over
7. mail and communication

*types of computer network

1.peer to peer network
2.client / server network

________________________________________________________
*peer to peer network

// peer to peer newrork is a network in which all the computer are linked together with equal privilage and responsibilites for processing the data.

// peer to peer network is useful for small environments, usually up to 10 computer.

// peer to peer network has no dedicated server.

// special permissions are assigned toe each computer for sharing the resources, but this can lead to a  problem if the computer with the resource is down.

comp1 <--> comp2 <---> comp3

* client / server network 

client / server network is a network model designed for the end users called clients,to access the resources such as songs , video etc. from a central computer known as server.

the central controller is known as server while all other computer in the network are called clients.

a server performs all the major operations such as security and network management.

a server is responsible for managing all the resources such files directories , printer, etc

all the clients communicate with each  other through a server. for example ,if client 1 wants to send some data to client 2 ,then 


server <---> internet
